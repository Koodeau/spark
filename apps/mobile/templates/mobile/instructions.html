        Ready to light up the world? To celebrate Mozilla Firefox going mobile, we've created Spark, a game that challenges you to share with friends to help the flame of the open Web glow bright. 
        So get Spark, take challenges, unlock badges and support Mozilla's mission for a better Web in the process. All good stuff!
